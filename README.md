# SCTLD sediment transmission

Scripts and data associated with a disease transmission experiment conducted at UM-CIMAS/NOAA-AOML (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/experimental-reef-lab/) to determine whether reef sediments can serve as an stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) vector. This repository is divided up into directories for transmission metrics, tissue histology, and 16S microbial community profiling.
